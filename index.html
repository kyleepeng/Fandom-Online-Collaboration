                    <p>Sarah Jiminez is one of many fans that utilizes social media to not 
                        only support their artists, but to collaborate with other fans around 
                        the world. The Korean pop (K-pop) fandom is a super community composed 
                        of fans of numerous K-pop groups such as BTS, Blackpink, and Girl’s 
                        Generation. It is estimated that the K-pop stan community has roughly 
                        100 million people, with BTS ARMY, fans of BTS, the most popular K-pop group, 
                        making up 50 million alone.

                        hashtag “#WhiteLivesMatter” on Twitter, flooding it with fan recorded 
                        videos and memes, making it a K-pop trending hashtag.

                    <p>We primarily explored the online presence and activity of BTS fans compared to that 
                        of two popular Western artists, Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber. Over the years, both 
                        Swift and Bieber have developed devoted fanbases, who identify themselves as Swifties 
                        and Beliebers respectively. For the purposes of this analysis, we used BTS fans as a 
                        proxy for K-pop fans in general as BTS ARMY are the largest subgroup of the K-pop community 
                        at 50 million strong.</p><br>

                    <img src='img/2_artists.png' class='img-with-text'> <br>

                    <p>We specifically focused on the period prior to and following an album release due to 
                        increased fan participation from new content. Fans can share their first impressions 
                        of the new album and spread the word about new music, hoping to push their artist’s 
                        music to popular record charts such as the Billboard Hot 100 Song. To account for technical 
                        and social developments, such as the rise of Twitter’s popularity, we chose albums from each 
                        artist that were released roughly around the same time. By comparing these three artists and 
                        fan participation levels during three of their releases, we gain a more quantified 
                        understanding of the social impact of musical fanbases online.

                    <p>For a wider scope of fan activity and artist popularity, we explored three different

                    <!-- google -->
                    <h5>Google Trends</h5>
                    <p>Google Trends analyzes the popularity of search queries inputted into Google’s search 
                        engine over a given period of time for various locations and languages. The data is an 
                        unbiased sample of Google search data that is anonymized, categorized, normalized, and 
                        aggregated to the time and location of a query. Search data can be filtered by category, 
                        such as “Arts and Entertainment” and “News”.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>Google Trends then computes and outputs a scaled popularity score on a range of 0 to 100, 
                        with 100 being the maximum possible search interest, by comparing the volume of the term’s 
                        searches to the overall volume of site searches for the set period and geography.

                    <img src='img/3_goo_popularity_all.png' class='img-with-text'> <br>


                    <p>When plotting both our Arts and Entertainment and general search, we see 
                        that BTS has had a steadier increase in interest compared to Swift or Bieber, 
                        who became “overnight sensations” and had a large spike in interest during their 
                        early career. On our Arts and Entertainment graph, it appears that Taylor Swift and 
                        Justin Bieber are on a downtrend in popularity, with interest spikes during album 
                        releases, after peaking in the early-mid 2000/2010s, with BTS overtaking Bieber in 
                        popularity around August 2018. Currently, all three artists have approximately the 
                        same level of Arts and Entertainment interest, with Swift having a slight lead 
                        over BTS and Bieber at the bottom of the three.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>Our general search plot shows a lower general interest rate for Taylor Swift and an 
                        increased interest in Justin Bieber and BTS. However, this plot shows a sharper 
                        decline in popularity for Bieber and higher increase for BTS in comparison to the 
                        Arts and Entertainment trends.  Despite 
                        Swift and Bieber’s established popularity, newcomer BTS has been able to unseat both of 
                        these popular Western artists in general search interest before the release of their 
                        second album.

                    <!-- twitter -->
                    <h5>Twitter</h5>
                    <p>To obtain our Twitter data, we used the Python API twint to scrape tweets without the 
                        limitations of the official API, which only allows for scraping up to seven days before 
                        the usage date. We determined “relevant” tweets during the aforementioned time periods 
                        by scraping Twitter for two hashtags per album: the most popular artist hashtag and the 
                        most popular album hashtag. For example, for BTS’s first album Dark & Wild, we scraped all 
                        tweets that contained the “query” hashtags #BTS and #DarkAndWild during the time period. 
                    </p> <br>

                    <p>Using twint, we scraped all the original tweets during the specific album release timeframes. 
                    </p> <br>


                    <p class='caption'>Summary Statistics for Twitter album data</p>
                    <img src='img/3_twit1.png' class='img-with-text'> <br>

                    <p>By sheer numbers, BTS Twitter fans appear to carry more weight per individual which more than 
                        compensates for their lower overall size throughout the three albums. By the third album, 
                        there are about 1.1 total tweets (including replies) per follower for BTS in that time period, 
                        while Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber average 0.020 and 0.0035 tweets per follower. Though BTS 
                        has a relatively smaller fanbase size as defined by the number of followers, its members are 
                        far and beyond more actively engaging on Twitter.
                    </p> <br>

                    <p>However, sheer numbers alone do not conclusively indicate collaboration. It is possible that 
                        the original tweets in our dataset could largely be independent individuals tweeting about 
                        their favorite artists/albums. As a specialty of fandom Twitter—not counting artist and public 
                        relations (PR) tweet contributions—there are two main subsets of users: content generators and 
                        amplifiers. 
                    </p> <br>

                    <img src='img/3_twit_users.png' class='img-with-text'><br>

                    <p>Naturally, content generators make up a very small portion of total Twitter users, but account 
                        for the majority of engagement. With the amount of engagement the content they push out receives, 
                        we consider them a primary driving force behind Twitter collaboration. So, by studying these content 
                        generators, we are better able to study the mechanisms behind collaboration on Twitter, opposed to 
                        just looking at raw numbers and assuming collaboration.
                    </p> <br>

                    <img src='img/3_twit2.png' class='img-with-text'><br>

                    <p>To fairly compare the role and power of content generators across the three artists and 
                        their albums, we normalized each of the albums to compare how the fanbases changed over 
                        the years. Since there is no simple way of classifying content generator users, we chose 
                        to analyze a curve borrowing the concept of the Lorenz Curve to calculate and visualize the 
                        A percentage of these few users (content generators) that account for B percentage of 
                        engagement (likes/retweets/replies). Mathematically:
                    </p>
                    
                    <img src='img/3_twit_formula.png'><br>
                    <p>To apply the Lorenz Curve concept, we looked at original tweets, since content generator 
                        tweets are all original tweets by definition. Visualizing and analyzing curves through 
                        that range allows us to effectively envision what content generator impact looks like. 
                    </p><br>

                    <!-- wikipedia -->
                    <h5>Wikipedia</h5>

                    <p>To obtain our Wikipedia revision history, we used the MediaWiki API to scrape the complete 
                        revision history in XML format of relevant articles, including their Talk pages. We scraped 
                        the main pages for each artist, and the pages for the albums of interest. (For example, for 
                        BTS, we scraped "BTS", "Talk: BTS", "Dark & Wild", and "Talk: Dark & Wild" among other 
                        albums.) In addition, we used the MediaWiki API to collect Wikipedia pageviews, which 
                        contain information about how many people viewed a certain Wikipedia page. 
                    </p><br>

                    <p>It’s important to note that the time that these Wikipedia articles have been active may 
                        play a factor into how much traction it received. Overall, the amount of edits on 
                        Wikipedia has been decreasing, with a 6.90% decrease from 2019-2020 alone. 
                        Taylor Swift’s article was created on June 4th, 2006; Justin Bieber’s on April 22nd, 
                        2008; and BTS’s following their debut on July 4th, 2013. To account for these differences, 
                        we normalized by the number of months since the article was released in Figure X to accurately 
                        compare the three articles. 
                    </p>

                    <img src='img/3_wiki_pageviews.png' class='img-with-text'><br>

                    <p>Overall, it appears that the trend in Wikipedia page views stays relatively constant with 
                        regular spikes. Notably, these large spikes can be correlated with recent album releases 
                        or other major career developments.
                    </p>
                    <p>For Taylor Swift, the obvious spikes in the pageviews correspond to the following events:
                        
                        <li>August 2017: Release of studio album ‘Reputation’</li>
                        <li>August 2019: Release of studio album ‘Lover’</li>
                        <li>December 2020: Release of studio album ‘Evermore’</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>For Justin Bieber, the two biggest spikes correspond to the release of ‘Despacito’ 
                        in April 2017 and the release of “No Brainer” in July of 2018. For BTS, the growth 
                        in pageviews begins in 2020, when their singles “Dynamite”  and “Life Goes On” reach 
                        number one on US Billboard Hot 100.
                    </p>
                        
                    <img src='img/3_wiki_revisions.png' class='img-with-text'><br>

                    <p>Revisions on Wikipedia give us a more direct measuremeant of collaboration on the 
                        platform. Based on revisions alone, it seems that editors who revise Taylor Swift’s 
                        Wikipedia page participate in a larger scale of collaboration than the other editors.

                    <p>With much rarer spikes in the data, it’s difficult to attribute major album release 
                        dates with more revisions on Wikipedia. Instead, we speculate that collaboration in 
                        the form of revisions most likely happens after an event that hasn’t been pre-announced 
                        occurs (for example, winning a Grammy’s award). We theorize that Taylor Swift’s 
                        first spikes in page revisions are correlated with the following events:
                        <li>Late 2007: Hersingles “Our Song” and “Should’ve Said No” reached number one on iTunes</li>
                        <li>Early 2012: Swift receives 2 Grammy awards at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards</li>
                        
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <img src='img/3_wiki_revision_length.png' class='img-with-text'><br>

                    <p>Revision length also gives us a deeper understanding into the rate of collaboration 
                        within each revision. Justin Bieber’s revision length history has noticeably more 
                        sudden dips, which might hint that editors are having more disagreements and thus 
                        need to delete each other’s work. BTS’s revision length history has the fastest 
                        growth of the three artists’ pages, suggesting that editors on BTS’s Wikipedia page 
                        collaborate on a faster timeline, contributing to more page content in a shorter amount 
                        of time than that of Taylor Swift’s or Justin Bieber’s.

                    <p>Editors on Wikipedia typically don’t edit many pages. Most editors in an article’s 
                        edit history only make 1 or 2 revisions, as evident in BTS and Justin Bieber’s 
                        editor contributions. However, when plotted on the same scale, there are much 
                        more editors on Taylor Swift’s page, with a larger number of editors making more 
                        than 1 contribution.

                    <p>
                        For our album-specific trend analysis, we examined both Arts and Entertainment related 
                        and general trend data to eliminate any possible misclassifications and attempt to 
                        understand the relative interest in our three musical artists in relation to the 
                        entertainment industry as well as general topics. Interest is defined daily rather than 
                        monthly as in our previous historical search.

                    <p>As we progress through the albums, it is evident that <strong>interest in BTS is rising 
                        while interest in Swift and Bieber has generally decreased</strong> in comparison to their 
                        earlier releases.

                    <h5>Twitter: BTS leads in Twitter engagement across all albums.</h5>
                    <p>As previously mentioned, our Twitter analysis primarily focused on identifying 
                        dedicated content creators responsible for the promotion and encouragement of Twitter 
                        engagement and subsequent collaboration during album releases. Prior to analyzing engagement 
                        content, we plotted the number of original (non-retweet) tweets per day during the album 
                        release periods to visualize the general creation trends. 
                    </p><br>

                    <p class='caption'>Original tweets per day for each album</p>
                    <img src='img/4_twit3.png' class='img-with-text'><br>

                    <p>From these plots, we see an expected trend: the number of tweets per day increases 
                        until peaks around the time of the album release before declining throughout the 
                        week following. These time-series give us an additional look at the sheer volume of 
                        tweets BTS fans are pumping out compared to Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber fans.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>In our content generator engagement analysis, we are looking to see which 
                        fanbase has the greatest percentage of content generators relative to the total engagement. 
                        From applying the content generator analysis across the three album releases for each 
                        artist, we are able to estimate the percentage of the total amount of likes, retweets, 
                        and replies that were accounted for by them for each of the three albums.

                    <img src='img/4_twit4.png' class='img-with-text'><br>
                    <p>During the time period of the first album, 
                        BTS had roughly 255k followers compared to the tens of millions that Taylor Swift 
                        and Justin Bieber had. Despite this, there were still a similar amount of unique tweets 
                        during the time period as seen in the figure above. BTS largely comes out on top of all 
                        three artists in these curves, meaning that their content generators were responsible for 
                        more of their total engagement.
                    </p><br>

                    <img src='img/4_twit5.png' class='img-with-text'><br>
                    <p>For the second albums, we see that BTS has begun to pull away, notably leading 
                        in both likes and retweets. BTS also has far higher Twitter engagement 
                        specifically for original tweets. From our analysis earlier, we see that there are 
                        significantly more BTS-related tweets per day, up to double to triple the amount 
                        for Swift or Bieber. We expect the denominator for our 
                        content generator percentage calculation to be that much larger since there are 
                        many more original tweets to be engaged with, but BTS content generators still 
                        consistently account for a higher 
                        majority of engagement than the other two artists.
                    </p>


                    <p class='caption'>Plots for 0-5% of Users Accounting for B% Engagement for the Third Albums</p>
                    <img src='img/4_twit6.png' class='img-with-text'><br>
                    <p>By the time we reach the third album, we again see that the sheer number original 
                        tweets per day about BTS has reached an entire order of magnitude higher than 
                        totals for either Taylor Swift or Justin Bieber. Despite this, BTS content generators 
                        still outperform the other artists’ content generators across the board for our 
                        percentage ranges. Through our analyses for these three periods of time, we see 
                        that the numbers support our hypothesis: <strong>BTS content generators make up more of 
                        the total engagement and better enable collaboration between members of the fanbase 
                        on Twitter.</strong>

                    <img src='img/4_wiki_pageviews.png'><br>

                    <p>We began our comparisons with albums that released after 2015, which is when the MediaWiki 
                        API began to collect page view data. We see that for our album two comparisons, 
                        the Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber album pages lead in views each day. There’s a 
                        general trend where the number of views increases prior to album release, peaks at album release, 
                        and decreases in the days after. However, Taylor Swift’s page views on her album pages 
                        have quadrupled that of BTS’s, suggesting that interest in her album, at least on Wikipedia, 
                        significantly outweighs the interest in BTS’s album and Justin Bieber’s album.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>The figure above compares the number of revisions for albums released during a similar 
                        time period for the three artists: BTS, Taylor Swift, and Justin Bieber. Although we 
                        expected more collaboration on the BTS wikipedia page from our Twitter analysis, the 
                        results actually show the opposite. Taylor Swift’s album page leads in the number of 
                        revisions, especially on the day of the album release. Revisions on Justin Bieber’s album 
                        page show a similar pattern, peaking on the day of his album release and slowly decreases 
                        as time goes on. This trend doesn’t appear with BTS’s album page as the number of revisions 
                        stays low throughout the 12 day interval.

                    <p>In addition, we also explored how the revision length changed over time for these album 
                        pages. The same upward slope is seen in all album pages (except for Taylor Swift's Folklore), 
                        suggesting a slow but steady effort in collaboration among Wikipedia editors. The article 
                        for Taylor Swift’s Folklore has a much steeper upward slope in 
                        revision length, suggesting that editors in Taylor Swift’s Folklore page were contributing 
                        more content with each revision.
