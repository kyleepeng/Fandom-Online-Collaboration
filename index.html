                <p>Sarah Jiminez is one of many fans that utilizes social media to not 
                    only support their artists, but to collaborate with other fans around 
                    the world. The Korean pop (K-pop) fandom is a super community composed 
                    of fans of numerous K-pop groups such as BTS, Blackpink, and Girl’s 
                    Generation. It is estimated that the K-pop stan community has roughly 
                    100 million people, with BTS ARMY, fans of BTS, the most popular K-pop group, 
                    making up 50 million alone.

                <p> In the wake of the protests surrounding the George Floyd murder, 
                    on June 3, 2020, K-pop fans collaborated and overtook white supremacist 
                    hashtag “#WhiteLivesMatter” on Twitter, flooding it with fan recorded 
                    videos and memes, making it a K-pop trending hashtag.

                <p>K-pop’s remarkable rise and global impact bring up the questions of: 
                    how can we effectively quantify and compare collaboration among fan 
                    groups on different online platforms? What distinguishes K-pop fans’ 
                    collaborative movements from others?

                <h3>Our Data</h3>
                <h5>Comparing Fan Activity during Album Release</h5>
                
                <p>We primarily explored the online presence and activity of BTS fans compared to that 
                    of two popular Western artists, Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber. Over the years, both 
                    Swift and Bieber have developed devoted fanbases, who identify themselves as Swifties 
                    and Beliebers respectively. For the purposes of this analysis, we used BTS fans as a 
                    proxy for K-pop fans in general as BTS ARMY are the largest subgroup of the K-pop community 
                    at 50 million strong.</p><br>

                <img src='img/2_artists.png' class='img-with-text'> <br>

                <p>We specifically focused on the period prior to and following an album release due to 
                    increased fan participation from new content. Fans can share their first impressions 
                    of the new album and spread the word about new music, hoping to push their artist’s 
                    music to popular record charts such as the Billboard Hot 100 Song. To account for technical 
                    and social developments, such as the rise of Twitter’s popularity, we chose albums from each 
                    artist that were released roughly around the same time. By comparing these three artists and 
                    fan participation levels during three of their releases, we gain a more quantified 
                    understanding of the social impact of musical fanbases online.
                </p><br>

                <h5>Our Data Sources</h5>
            
                <p>For a wider scope of fan activity and artist popularity, we explored three different 
                    online platforms: Google Trends, Twitter, and Wikipedia. These data sources give us multiple 
                    facets for collaboration to compare with varying levels of required commitment, 
                    from easiest (Twitter likes) to hardest (Wikipedia revisions).

                <h5>Google Trends</h5>
                <p></p>
                
                <!-- twitter -->
                <h5>Twitter</h5>
                <p>To obtain our Twitter data, we used the Python API twint to scrape tweets without the 
                    limitations of the official API, which only allows for scraping up to seven days before 
                    the usage date. We determined “relevant” tweets during the aforementioned time periods 
                    by scraping Twitter for two hashtags per album: the most popular artist hashtag and the 
                    most popular album hashtag. For example, for BTS’s first album Dark & Wild, we scraped all 
                    tweets that contained the “query” hashtags #BTS and #DarkAndWild during the time period. 
                </p> <br>

                <p>Using twint, we scraped all the original tweets during the specific album release timeframes. 
                    Here's the summary statistics for our Twitter album data: 
                </p> <br>

                <img src='img/3_twit1.png' class='img-with-text'> <br>

                <p>By sheer numbers, BTS Twitter fans appear to carry more weight per individual which more than 
                    compensates for their lower overall size throughout the three albums. By the third album, 
                    there are about 1.1 total tweets (including replies) per follower for BTS in that time period, 
                    while Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber average 0.020 and 0.0035 tweets per follower. Though BTS 
                    has a relatively smaller fanbase size as defined by the number of followers, its members are 
                    far and beyond more actively engaging on Twitter.
                </p> <br>

                <p>However, sheer numbers alone do not conclusively indicate collaboration. It is possible that 
                    the original tweets in our dataset could largely be independent individuals tweeting about 
                    their favorite artists/albums. As a specialty of fandom Twitter—not counting artist and public 
                    relations (PR) tweet contributions—there are two main subsets of users: content generators and 
                    amplifiers. 
                </p> <br>

                <img src='img/3_twit_users.png' class='img-with-text'><br>

                <p>Naturally, content generators make up a very small portion of total Twitter users, but account 
                    for the majority of engagement. With the amount of engagement the content they push out receives, 
                    we consider them a primary driving force behind Twitter collaboration. So, by studying these content 
                    generators, we are better able to study the mechanisms behind collaboration on Twitter, opposed to 
                    just looking at raw numbers and assuming collaboration.
                </p> <br>

                <img src='img/3_twit2.png' class='img-with-text'><br>

                <p>To fairly compare the role and power of content generators across the three artists and 
                    their albums, we normalized each of the albums to compare how the fanbases changed over 
                    the years. Since there is no simple way of classifying content generator users, we chose 
                    to analyze a curve borrowing the concept of the Lorenz Curve to calculate and visualize the 
                    A percentage of these few users (content generators) that account for B percentage of 
                    engagement (likes/retweets/replies). Mathematically:
                </p>
                
                <img src='img/3_twit_formula.png'><br>
                <p>To apply the Lorenz Curve concept, we looked at original tweets, since content generator 
                    tweets are all original tweets by definition. Visualizing and analyzing curves through 
                    that range allows us to effectively envision what content generator impact looks like.
