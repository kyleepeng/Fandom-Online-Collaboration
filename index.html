                <p>Sarah Jiminez is one of many ARMYs that utilizes social media to not 
                    only support their artists, but to collaborate with other fans around 
                    the world. In the wake of the protests surrounding the George Floyd murder, 
                    on June 3, 2020, K-pop fans collaborated and overtook white supremacist 
                    hashtag “#WhiteLivesMatter” on Twitter, flooding it with fan recorded 
                    videos and memes, making it a K-pop trending hashtag.</p> <br>

                <h3>Our Data</h3>
                <h5>Comparing Fan Activity during Album Release</h5>
                
                <p>We primarily explored the online presence and activity of BTS fans compared to that 
                    of two popular Western artists, Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber. Over the years, both 
                    Swift and Bieber have developed devoted fanbases, who identify themselves as Swifties 
                    and Beliebers respectively. For the purposes of this analysis, we used BTS fans as a 
                    proxy for K-pop fans in general as BTS ARMY are the largest subgroup of the K-pop community 
                    at 50 million strong.</p><br>

                <img src='img/2_artists.png' class='img-with-text'> <br>

                <p>We specifically focused on the period prior to and following an album release due to 
                    increased fan participation from new content. Fans can share their first impressions 
                    of the new album and spread the word about new music, hoping to push their artist’s 
                    music to popular record charts such as the Billboard Hot 100 Song. To account for technical 
                    and social developments, such as the rise of Twitter’s popularity, we chose albums from each 
                    artist that were released roughly around the same time. By comparing these three artists and 
                    fan participation levels during three of their releases, we gain a more quantified 
                    understanding of the social impact of musical fanbases online.

                <h5>Our Data Sources</h5>
            
                <p>For a wider scope of fan activity and artist popularity, we explored three different 
                    online platforms: Google Trends, Twitter, and Wikipedia. These data sources give us multiple 
                    facets for collaboration to compare with varying levels of required commitment, 
                    from easiest (Twitter likes) to hardest (Wikipedia revisions).</p> <br>
